Deimos (systematic designation: Mars II) is the smaller and outer of the two natural satellites of the planet Mars, the other being Phobos.
Deimos has a mean radius of 6.2 km (3.9 mi) and takes 30.3 hours to orbit Mars.
The name Deimos is pronounced /ˈdaɪmɒs/ dy-mos, or sometimes /ˈdiːməs/ dee-məs or like the Greek Δείμος.
In Greek mythology, Deimos was the twin brother of Phobos and personified terror.

Deimos is 23,460 km (14,580 mi) from Mars, much further than Mars's other moon, Phobos.

NEWLINE NEWLINE
Deimos, like Mars's other moon, Phobos, has spectra, albedos and densities similar to those of a C- or D-type asteroid.
Like most bodies of its size, Deimos is highly non-spherical with triaxial dimensions of 15 × 12.2 × 11 km, making it 0.56 times the size of Phobos.

NEWLINE NEWLINE

Deimos is composed of rock rich in carbonaceous material, much like C-type asteroids and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.
It is cratered, but the surface is noticeably smoother than that of Phobos, caused by the partial filling of craters with regolith.
The regolith is highly porous and has a radar-estimated density of only 1.471 g/cm3. The two largest craters, Swift and Voltaire, each measure about 3 km (1.9 mi) across.

NEWLINE NEWLINE
It has an escape velocity of 5.6 m/s and apparent magnitude of 12.45.
