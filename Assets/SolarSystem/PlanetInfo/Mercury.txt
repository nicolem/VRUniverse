Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, 
 and is a rocky body like Earth. It is the smallest planet in the 
 Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).
 Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural 
 satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of 
 approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material. Mercury's density is the 
 second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's  
 density of 5.515 g/cm3. If the effect of gravitational compression were to be 
 factored out, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser,
 with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3. NEWLINE

 
Mercury's density can be used to infer details of its inner structure.
 Although Earth's high density results appreciably from gravitational compression,
 particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. 
Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.
